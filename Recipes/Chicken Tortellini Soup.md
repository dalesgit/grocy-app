### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
- 3 small carrots, peeled and thinly sliced (about 1 cup)
- 1 large celery stalk, finely chopped (about ½ cup)
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped (1 tablespoon)
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon, divided
- 1½ teaspoons salt-free garlic-and-herb seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 5 cups unsalted chicken broth
- 1 (9-ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini (such as Buitoni)
- 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken
- 2 cups packed finely chopped baby spinach
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- 1 cup heavy cream

### Instructions

- Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrots, celery and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon tarragon, 1½ teaspoons garlic-and-herb seasoning, ¼ teaspoon pepper and ⅛ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
- Stir in 5 cups broth; cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir in 1 (9-ounce) package tortellini. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until al dente, about 5 minutes.
- Increase heat to medium. Stir in 2 cups chicken, 2 cups spinach, 1 cup peas and 1 cup cream; cook, uncovered and stirring often, until the spinach is wilted and the peas are bright green, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Ladle the soup into 6 bowls and sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon tarragon.
