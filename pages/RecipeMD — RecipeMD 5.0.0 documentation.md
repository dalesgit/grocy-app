# RecipeMD — RecipeMD 5.0.0 documentation

> ## Excerpt
> A standard format for recipes as Markdown files and a
python reference implementation. The reference implementation can be used as a
CLI program and as a python library.

---
A [standard format](https://recipemd.org/specification.html) for recipes as [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) files and a [python reference implementation](https://recipemd.org/reference_implementation.html). The reference implementation can be used as a [CLI program](https://recipemd.org/cli.html) and as a [python library](https://recipemd.org/_apidoc/recipemd.html).

## Quick Start

1.  Install the tool: `pip install recipemd` (optionally you can also [install shell completions](https://recipemd.org/install.html#install-completions))
    
2.  Look at some [example recipes](https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD/tree/master/examples) or start with a [recipe template](https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD/tree/master/examples/template.md) to create your own recipes
    
3.  Learn how to use the CLI tool with some [example calls](https://recipemd.org/cli.html#cli-examples)
    

## Specification

We provide a [specification](https://recipemd.org/specification.html) for RecipeMD so other tools can use the format. The specification also comes with a set of [test cases](https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD/tree/master/testcases).

## Contributing

You can take part in RecipeMD’s development in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RecipeMD/RecipeMD).

## Resources

You can use [recipemd-extract](https://github.com/AberDerBart/recipemd-extract) to fetch and extract recipes from the web. We also maintain a [list of recommended tools](https://recipemd.org/recommended_tools.html) that work nicely with RecipeMD recipes.
