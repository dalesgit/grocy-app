# Ingredients

- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup finely chopped carrots
- 1 cup finely chopped onions
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes with juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves, or more to taste
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 3-inch wide baguette, cut diagonally into about 20 (1/2-inch) slices
- 4 ounces unsalted butter, room temperature
- 3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 Tablespoon minced Italian flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- fresh basil leaves (optional)

# Directions

- For soup, heat olive oil in a 3 to 4 quart pot over medium heat. Add carrots and onions, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
- Add dried basil, salt, and black pepper, and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and their juices along with vegetable broth. Stir, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and slowly simmer 20 to 25 minutes, uncovered. Add minced fresh basil and cream and simmer about 5 minutes more.
- Puree the soup with a stick blender or a blender. Taste and adjust seasonings.
- Meanwhile, for crostini, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place baguette slices on the prepared pan.
- Combine butter, granulated garlic, salt, and minced parsley in a bowl. Use a spatula to mash and stir until well mixed. Add shredded Parmesan and stir until a paste is formed.
- Spread about 1 tablespoon garlic-Parmesan paste on each baguette slice.
- Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crunchy, 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned and crunchy.
- To serve, ladle soup into serving bowls and serve with crostini. Garnish with fresh basil.
