Cut the meat into cubes, about 4x4 cm. Keep all tendons and fat. Peel the onions and finely dice them. Preheat a large pot on high heat. Add lard and fry the meat in batches until brown. Set it aside. Add the onions and the sugar to the pot, reduce the heat to medium and slowly fry them until deeply golden brown, about 20 minutes. 

Place the meat back in the pot. Add the beer. Close the pot with a lid and bake at 80 °C for about three hours.

Add caraway seeds, majoram, paprika powder and chili powder. Bring to a simmer, then add enough water to cover the meat 2/3 of the way. Add salt and vinegar and simmer for about 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 120 °C. Cover the pot again and place in the oven for about one hour. Add enough water to cover the meat, then reduce the heat to 80 °C and keep baking for six hours. 

If you need to, you can take a break at any point, just put the goulash in the fridge and continue cooking where you left off - letting it infuse like that actually benefits the flavor. Similarly, letting it rest and reheating before serving benefits the flavor.
