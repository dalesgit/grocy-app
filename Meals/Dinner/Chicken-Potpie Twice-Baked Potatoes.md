# Ingredients

- 4 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed
- ½ cup half-and-half
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
- 2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken
- 1 cup frozen carrots and peas, thawed
- ¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground pepper

# Directions

- Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Pierce potatoes all over with a fork and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the skin is crispy and the potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. (Alternatively, place potatoes on a microwave-safe plate; microwave on High until a fork can easily be inserted into centers, 10 to 12 minutes.) Let the potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes; reserve the foil-lined baking sheet.
- Cut the cooled potatoes in half lengthwise; scoop the flesh into a large bowl. Place the skins, hollowed-side up, on the reserved baking sheet. Add ½ cup half-and-half and ¼ cup cubed butter to the potatoes; mash to combine. Stir in 2 cups chicken, 1 cup carrots and peas, ¼ cup cheese, 1 tablespoon each thyme and chives and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper.
- Divide the chicken mixture among the potato skins; sprinkle with the remaining ½ cup cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Garnish with additional thyme and chives, if desired.
