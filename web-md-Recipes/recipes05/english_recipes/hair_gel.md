# Flax Seed Hair Gel

**300 ml**

---

- *600 ml* water
- *80 g* whole flax seed
- essential oil for smell (optional)

---

Bring water and flax seed to a boil. Let simmer until the liquid becomes thicker and you can make out slimy streaks. Take of the heat and let sit for 30 to 60 minutes.

Filter the cooled-down gel: Use a nylon stocking, a gauze cloth, a cheese cloth, a nut milk bag or a kitchen towel. Press the gel through your filter of choice using your hands.
Optionally, add the essential oil. Store the finished gel in the fridge for two weeks or in the freezer (use ice cube trays!) almost indefinitely.

You can still use the remaining flax seed for almost any use. Bake them into bread, add them to a soup or smoothie, just be sure to use them up soon!
