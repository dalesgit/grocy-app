Peel the potatoes, wash them and cut into 1.5 - 2 cm cubes. Set aside.

Peel the onions for the sauce, cut in half and then into even, fine rings. In a large pot, fry them with some of the oil on high heat for 30 minutes while stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium and fry for additional 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. They should be soft and lightly brown.

Peel and grate the garlic. Add to the onions an let fry for two more minutes.

Add paprika powder, roast until fragrant. Deglaze with the vinegar. Add tomato paste, majoram, caraway seeds, coriander seeds and half the stock. Stir to combine and let simmer to reduce.

Add the remaining stock and let reduce until creamy.

Optionally, remove the pot from the heat, and blend until smooth.

Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add sugar, salt, pepper and bay leaves.

Add the potatoes and just enough water to cover them. Let simmer without a lid for about half an hour, stirring occasionally. Add water as needed to keep the potatoes covered.

Cut the remaining onions and the bell peppers into stripes. Fry the onions in a pan until translucent, add the bell peppers and fry until just browned. Add to the goulash.

Continue to let the goulash simmer until the potatoes are just soft.

For a topping combine the sour cream, chopped herbs and thinly sliced scallion.

Season the goulash with salt to taste. Serve with the topping and bread rolls or wholegrain rye bread.
