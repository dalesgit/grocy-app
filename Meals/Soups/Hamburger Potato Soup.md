# Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 lb. ground beef (I use 90/10)
- 4  large russet potatoes (about 2 lbs., peeled and cut in 1/2-inch cubes)
- 1  medium yellow onion (diced small)
- 2  large carrots (diced small)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 teaspoon dried parsley
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups whole milk
- Â¼ cup flour (all-purpose)
- 1 pound Velveeta Cheese (16 oz., cut into chunks)
- Optional toppings (shredded cheddar cheese, sliced green onions)

# Directions

- Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, onion, carrots, salt, pepper, and parsley. Cook beef until meat is browned and onions are translucent. Drain any excess grease.
- Add the garlic to the skillet and cook for about two minutes or until fragrant.
- Sprinkle the meat and vegetable mixture with the flour, making sure the meat is evenly coated. Stir and cook 1-2 minutes to remove the raw taste from the flour.
- Add the broth, taking care to deglaze the bottom of the pot, scraping vigorously with a wooden spoon or spatula to remove any stuck-on bits.
- Add the potatoes, milk, and Velveeta cheese. Bring to a boil while stirring continuously. Reduce the heat and simmer soup for 25-35 minutes or until potatoes and carrots are tender; continue to stir to prevent scorching. Garnish with shredded cheese and green onions.
