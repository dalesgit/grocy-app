# Ingredients

- 0.75 cup hot salsa
- 0.25 cup chunky peanut butter
- 0.75 cup light coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 pounds skinless chicken thighs
- 0.5 cup chopped peanuts, for topping
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, for topping

# Directions

- Combine salsa, peanut butter, coconut milk, lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, and ginger in the slow cooker; mix well. Place chicken thighs in sauce; spoon sauce over chicken to coat.
- Cover and cook on Low until chicken is very tender and sauce has thickened, 8 to 9 hours. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with peanuts and cilantro before serving.
