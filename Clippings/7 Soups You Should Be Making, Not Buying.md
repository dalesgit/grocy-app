Roasting the vegetables in the oven before blending them intensifies their flavors, resulting in a deeply rich and flavorful fall soup. We love the sweet and nutty flavor of butternut squash, but any winter squash with a similar texture, such as acorn, honeynut or kabocha squash, can be used in its place.

Classic chicken noodle soup gets a healthy upgrade with low-sodium chicken broth, whole-wheat egg noodles and tons of vegetables. To get a homemade stock flavor using store-bought broth, we simmer bone-in chicken breasts in the broth before adding the rest of the soup ingredients. But you're short on time, feel free to use pre-cooked chicken and start the recipe at step 2.

## Healthy Cream of Mushroom Soup

Healthy Cream of Mushroom Soup

This healthy version of the traditional cream of mushroom soup calls for you to puree half of the soup for that rich, creamy mouthfeel and leave the other half as is for hits of meaty texture. Don't skip the parsley and tarragon as both add a nice pop of color, and their flavors play so well with the mushrooms. Be sure to brown the mushrooms well as that'll add even more depth to the soup.

The Sichuan province in the southwestern corner of China is known for its fiery dishes. Here, the richness of tahini tempers the spicy chile paste in this cup-of-noodles-style mason jar soup recipe. This vegan cup soup is packed with 19 grams of protein to keep you satisfied until your next meal. You can grind the Sichuan peppercorns in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, or crush them with the bottom of a heavy skillet.

Hominy adds mild corn flavor, while poblanos provide smokiness in this chicken tortilla soup recipe. Spices like cumin, coriander and smoked paprika bring a bold flavor that's balanced by fresh lime juice.
