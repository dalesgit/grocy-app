I once heard someone suggest that veggie Shepherd's Pie be called Gardener's Pie and I think that's a fantastic idea.

## Mashed Potatoes

For the mashed potatoes, peel potatoes and boil in salted water until soft. Drain and mash potatoes into mashed potatoes with vegetable milk and butter.

## Lentil Filling

For the lentil filling, peel and dice onion. Clean and dice soup vegetables. Mix starch with a little water and set aside.

Heat oil in pot. Sauté onion and soup vegetables. Add tomato paste. Add lentils, remaining water, bay leaf, savory, cinnamon, thyme, oregano and bring to a boil. Season broth with Marmite, Worchester sauce, pepper and salt. Cook lentils until tender and they have absorbed most of the water. Mix starch with a bit of cold water, add to lentils and bring to a boil. Stir in corn.

Pour lentil mixture into a baking dish. Spread mashed potatoes on top. Bake in oven at 200 °C convection setting (220 °C otherwise) for about 20 minutes, until casserole is golden brown. Sprinkle with parsley, let cool for about ten minutes (otherwise the casserole will be very runny) and serve.
