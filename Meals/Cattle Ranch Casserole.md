# Ingredients

- 2 	cups Bisquick baking mix
- 1 1/4 	cups whole milk
- 2 	Tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 	pounds lean ground beef
- 1 	onion, chopped
- 1-2	poblano peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1 	packet taco seasoning
- 1/2 	teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 	cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 	cup sour cream, plus more for garnish
- 2 	cups shredded pepper jack cheese, divided
- 2	cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with Hatch green chiles, drained
- 1/2	cup chopped cilantro or green onions for garnish

# Directions

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
- Stir baking mix, milk, and 1 tablespoon oil together in a bowl. Spread evenly in the prepared baking dish. 
- Bake in the preheated oven until just starting to turn golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. This step is just par-baking - this layer will not be fully baked at this point. Remove from the oven and set aside. 
- Heat remaining tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through, about 4 minutes. 
- Add onion and poblano, stirring occasionally, until the beef is cooked through and onions begin to soften, about 4 minutes more. Stir in taco seasoning and salt until evenly combined. Remove from heat; set aside.
- Add mayonnaise, sour cream, 1 cup pepper Jack cheese, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese to a bowl; stir until well combined.
- Spoon beef mixture evenly over par-baked biscuit in the baking dish. Sprinkle drained diced tomatoes evenly over beef. Carefully spoon mayonnaise mixture over beef and tomatoes. Sprinkle evenly with remaining shredded cheese.
- Bake, uncovered, until cheese is bubbly and starting to turn golden brown, about 30 minutes. 
- Let the dish rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with sour cream and cilantro or green onions.
