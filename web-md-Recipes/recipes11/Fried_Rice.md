1. Chop vegetables.
2. Wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel to suck out the liquid, dice in 1cm cubes.
3. Put tofu dice in a well heated and oiled cast iron pan and brown on all sides.
4. While the tofu fries prepare your rice and add some rice vinegar for extra flavour. Boil on high uncovered for 30 minutes, then strain for 10 seconds and return to pot removed from the heat. Cover with a lid and let steam for 10 minutes.
5. While rice and tofu are cooking, prepare sauce by adding all ingredients to a medium-size mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed.
6. Once the tofu is golden brown, add directly to the sauce and marinate for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once hot, use a slotted spoon to scoop the tofu into the pan leaving most of the sauce behind. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown on all sides. Lower heat if browning too quickly. Remove from pan and set aside.
8. To the still hot pan add garlic, green onion, broccoli, peas and carrots. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, and season with 1 Tbsp soy sauce.
9. Add cooked rice, tofu, and remaining sauce and stir. Cook over medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently.
10. Serve immediately with extra chili garlic sauce or sriracha for heat. Crushed salted, roasted peanuts or cashews make a lovely additional garnish. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, though best when fresh. Reheat in a skillet over medium heat or in the microwave.
