# Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 0.5 pound Italian-style chicken sausage, casings removed
- 1.5 cups diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (15 ounce) can white kidney beans (cannellini), rinsed and drained

- 1 (32 ounce) carton SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth (4 cups)
- 3 cups finely chopped kale leaves
