# Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 4 bacon
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 medium celery, diced
- 1 small onion, diced
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 0.25 cup all-purpose flour
- 1.5 cups milk
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, plus more for garnish
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

# Directions

- Gather all ingredients.
- Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, discard grease, and set aside.
- Meanwhile, place bacon in a 3-quart saucepan, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove crisped bacon with a slotted spoon and set on paper towels to drain. Leave bacon grease in the saucepan.
- Saut√© carrots, celery, and onion in the bacon grease until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Add broth, potatoes, and browned ground beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
- Meanwhile, wipe out the skillet you previously cooked the beef in. Melt butter in the skillet and whisk in flour; cook, stirring frequently, until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully whisk milk into flour-butter mixture until well combined and very smooth.
- Pour milk mixture into the soup, whisking to combine; bring to a boil and simmer for about 2 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted. Season with basil, parsley, salt, and pepper.
- Remove from heat. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with bacon and additional shredded Cheddar cheese.
