A professor at Rutgers University who wrote a book about “[antifa](https://www.wired.com/story/antifa-social-media-rumor-forks-washington/)” almost a decade ago is trying—and struggling—to flee the US for Europe after a weeks-long online campaign against him by [far-right influencers](https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/) was followed by death threats.

Mark Bray, a historian at Rutgers who specializes in Spanish history and radicalism, has been a far-right target ever since he published *Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook* in 2017. But after president Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to designate antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization,” social media posts from far-right figures and a petition promoted by conservative student activists demonized Bray as an “antifa member” who was “supporting terrorist behavior." Dozens of targeted threats followed.

The threats, emailed from anonymous accounts and reviewed by WIRED, included a message that read: “I’ll kill you in front of your students.” Another message, with the subject line “your violent rhetoric is under investigation,” listed Bray’s home address where he lives with his wife and two young children.

“We made the decision on Saturday \[to leave the US\] when our home address became known by people who want to do us harm,” says Bray. The professor informed his students on Sunday that he would be moving to Europe as a result of the threats.

But at the airport, after they had already scanned their passports, received boarding passes, checked in their bags, and cleared security, Bray says he and his family were not allowed to board their flight. Upon arrival at their boarding gate, their reservations had suddenly disappeared from the United Airlines system.

"For 20 minutes \[United Airlines\] couldn't even figure out what had happened,” says Bray. “Then they said that, basically, somehow someone had canceled our reservation, presumably in between checking through and then. I don't know what happened. There are various potential explanations, but I don't think it was a coincidence that it happened to us on that day.”

Bray says that he has been rebooked on flights to Spain. “We're going to try it one more time,” says Bray. “If it doesn't work, then we'll do something else.”

United Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House did not comment and redirected WIRED to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. “We got this from the White House and are trying to get ground truth but are not tracking anything like this from TSA or CBP,” says Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS.

After publishing *Antifa*, Bray donated half of the profits from the book to the International Anti-Fascist Defense Fund, a group which supports antifascist activists around the world. He was soon placed on the so-called Professor Watchlist by Turning Point USA (TPUSA), the conservative activist group cofounded by Charlie Kirk. The list, which showcases academics that TPUSA claims are pushing leftist propaganda, has been criticized as a threat to academic freedom.

Antifa is viewed by the [Trump administration](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/26/dhs-fighting-back-against-antifa-violence) and many on the right as a dangerous network of violent left-wing activist groups intent on destroying US conservative values. In reality, antifa is not an organization at all, but a broad ideology embraced by antifascist activists around the world.

At the time his book was published, Bray says he did receive some death threats. But it soon blew over: “The difference was that I was renting so no one found my home address, and so it just didn't reach this fever pitch,” says Bray. “But also now I have a family and so that's relevant as well.”

Bray received attention in 2020, as well, when some conservative commentators blamed the protests held over the police killing of George Floyd on antifa. Bray received very little attention from those on the right until Trump issued his antifa executive order on September 22.

“It's manufactured outrage,” says Bray. “Trump is trying to look for a boogeyman and using this kind of nebulous term that is misunderstood in the public eye, a convenient way for him to demonize the left and anyone who opposes his administration.”

Days after the executive order was signed, the Department of Homeland Security [published a memo](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/26/dhs-fighting-back-against-antifa-violence#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Department%20of%20Homeland,riots%20throughout%20the%20United%20States.) that highlighted the perceived threat from antifa and “antifa-aligned domestic terrorists.”

In the wake of Trump’s executive order, far-right influencers once again jumped on Bray after he [spoke to media outlets](https://www.thecut.com/article/trump-antifa-executive-order-protests-explained.html) about Trump’s order. “I think I ought to visit,” wrote far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos on X, quoting a post about Bray’s work at Rutgers. Jack Posobiec, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist who was recently invited by the Republican National Committee [to train some poll workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/us/politics/republican-national-committee-2024-posobiec.html), called Bray a “domestic terrorist professor.”

“The day after the Posobiec tweet, I received a very direct death threat saying that someone was going to kill me in front of my students,” says Bray.

When asked for comment, Posobiec simply repeated the claim he made in his X post. Yiannopoulos did not respond to a request for comment.

Posobiec was one of a number of far-right influencers who attended a White House event on Wednesday where Trump led a roundtable on the supposed rise and danger of antifa. During the event, which was also attended by secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, influencers were invited to share stories about their interactions with antifa.

One speaker, far-right influencer Andy Ngo, has spent years targeting Bray online. He has called him a “financier” of antifa, and has recently posted repeatedly about Bray. “Bray is a financier of antifa and advocates for their violence,” Ngo wrote on X last weekend. Ngo did not respond to a request for comment.

On October 2, Megyn Doyle, the treasurer of TPUSA's Rutgers chapter, launched a Change.org petition with the title: “Remove Antifa financier & Professor, Mark Bray from Rutgers University.” The petition questioned why Rutgers employed a professor who was, the petition claims, “supporting terrorist behavior.”

“We, the students of Rutgers University, are deeply concerned to learn that an outspoken, well-known antifa member, Dr. Mark Bray, is employed by the university,” Doyle wrote in the petition. “Dr. Mark Bray, whom we call Dr. Antifa, wrote the antifa handbook, which is a guideline to what he refers to as “militant anti-fascism.”

Doyle also suggested that Bray’s public comments were similar to “the kind of rhetoric that resulted in [Charlie Kirk being assassinated](https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/) last month.” In an update three days after she first posted the petition, Doyle said: "I do not endorse death threats, doxxing, or harassment and would not wish them on anyone, especially Mark Bray."

Two days after the petition launched, Fox News ran a story about it on their website and quoted Doyle. Bray says he refused to provide a comment to Fox News, claiming that at the time the petition had fewer than 100 signatures. At the time of publication the petition had amassed almost 1,000 signatures.

“It seemed to me a bit odd to have a news story about a relatively small Change.org petition,” says Bray. “Fox News was trying to generate a story that would get clicks \[and\] when the Fox News story came out on Saturday, within a few hours I received another death threat and another threatening email that had my full address in it which very much disturbed me.”

Doyle, TPUSA, and FOX News did not respond to a request for comment.

At that point, Bray says, he and his family made the decision to leave the US and move to Spain. WIRED spoke to Bray on Monday as he was preparing to leave the US, and he said he had just received another death threat that morning, and his address was still getting posted online.

Scores of Bray’s [former students](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1nz2d1a/this_is_wild_feel_bad_for_prof_bray/) have jumped to his defense. One of them tells WIRED that his classmates were “disappointed” that he was leaving the US.

“His classes were always very lively and discussion based,” they add, “but due to him having to move to Europe, the class will be asynchronous and no longer have the same quality discussions.”

Bray says the Rutgers administration has been supportive, and says that he met with a dean at the university last week to discuss moving his classes to a different room on campus and taking down the public listing of his classes. As the situation escalated over the weekend, such actions became moot.

“The University is aware of the Change.org petition regarding Professor Mark Bray and Dr. Bray’s message to his students,” says Patti Zielinski, a spokesperson for Rutgers. “We are gathering more information about this evolving situation.”

Bray reported the threats to both the Rutgers University Police Department and the police department in the town where he lives. Neither responded to WIRED’s requests for comment.

While Bray says he’s aware that most people who make threats online never take action, there have been enough recent instances of political violence that he thought it was “better to be safe than sorry” to temporarily relocate to Spain.

Bray, who says he plans to stay in Spain until the end of academic year, made his situation public to fight back against what he sees as a concerted effort to silence anyone who speaks out about the current administration.

“I don't see this as an aberration,” says Bray. “I don't think this is the end, and that's partly why I wanted to \[make it public\] so people can make more of an effort to plan, take collective action and protect academic freedom and the right to dissent in this country.”
