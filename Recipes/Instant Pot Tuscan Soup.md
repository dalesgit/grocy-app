# Ingredients

- 0.5 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 0.5 cup peeled and chopped carrot
- 0.5 cup sliced celery
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 0.5 cup frozen whole kernel corn, thawed
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 (32 ounce) carton Swanson® Chicken Broth (4 cups)
- 2 (8 inch) corn tortillas, cut into strips
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
- 1 avocado, chopped
- 1 jalapeno pepper, sliced, or to taste

# Directions

- Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken, carrot, celery, beans, corn, tomato paste, cumin, chili powder, and Swanson® Chicken Broth to a 6-quart Instant Pot.
- Lock the lid and close the pressure release valve. Pressure cook on High pressure, setting the timer to 5 minutes (timer will begin counting down once pressure is reached- it takes about 15 minutes). When done, press Cancel and use the quick-release method to release the pressure.
- Remove the chicken from the pot. Shred the chicken and return to the pot. Season to taste. Serve topped with tortilla strips, fresh chopped cilantro, avocado, or sliced jalapeño pepper, if desired.
