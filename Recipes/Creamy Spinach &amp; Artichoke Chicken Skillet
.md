### Ingredients

- 4 (4-ounce) chicken cutlets
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper, plus more for garnish
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 shallots, chopped (about ½ cup)
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup unsalted chicken broth
- 6 cups spinach, chopped
- 1 cup canned quartered artichoke hearts, rinsed and chopped
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ¼ cup cream cheese, cubed and softened
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

### Instructions

- Sprinkle chicken with ¼ teaspoon pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook until golden brown on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion registers 165°F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Do not wipe the skillet clean.
- Add shallots, garlic and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the shallot is translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons flour; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ¼ cup wine; cook, undisturbed, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 seconds. Whisking constantly, add ½ cup broth in a steady stream. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Add spinach and artichokes; cook, stirring often, until the spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ½ cup cream, ¼ cup cream cheese, ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper (if using) and ⅛ teaspoon salt. Return the chicken to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream cheese has melted, 2 to 3 minutes
- Remove from heat. Add ¼ cup Parmesan and 2 tablespoons basil; stir until the Parmesan is melted, about 1 minute. Garnish with pepper, if desired.
