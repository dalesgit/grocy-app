## Why Are Spices Important?

Spices are the most crucial part of cooking. Flavor is built with spices. Your creativity can really shine with spices as well. Without spices and herbs, our food would be really bland. Knowing what to use, how much to use and when to use it is very important.

## Where Do Spices Come From?

Spices come from all parts of plants. They come from seeds, flowers, bark, berries, leaves and stems. Isn't that fascinating? Spices come from all over the world and are readily available in major grocery stores and online.

There are so many different spices used in cooking and the best way to get familiar with them is to cook with them. I implore you to try your spices by themselves to really be able to taste them. This will help you learn how to use them in dishes.

## Cooking with Spices

As you start to cook more you will be able to really grow your spice collection to what fits your needs. And learn what you and your family like to cook with. For the most part though, most dishes can come together and be delicious with the essential spices I have listed. These are pretty basic spices, but still pack a lot of flavor when used in cooking.

## Shelf Life of Spices

One thing to keep in mind though is to not purchase more than what you would need for 6 months to a year. Spices are best used the fresher they are. I am not saying that you will not get any flavor from a spice after a year, just that it will not have as much flavor.

## Spice Cabinet Essentials

Let's get into this!

**Salt** - No dish, savory or sweet is complete without salt. Salt is the number 1 essential spice to keep in the kitchen.

**Pepper** - The most popular spice in the world! Freshly ground pepper packs the best flavor. I like to keep a blend of peppercorns in my pepper mill. I also go heavy handed with this berry when seasoning my food. That's right, peppercorns are actually dried berries. Just like salt, pepper is used to add flavor to just about every savory, and some sweet, dishes.

**Garlic Powder** - So much concentrated garlic flavor packed into a little jar. Everyone loves garlic! Garlic powder is my number 2 essential spice for the spice cabinet. Using garlic powder in a dish will definitely add tons of flavor.

**Onion Powder** - I firmly believe that onions go in just about every savory dish because they add so much flavor. However, onion powder has a much more concentrated flavor and should be used sparingly. It does still belong in ever spice cabinet.

**Paprika** - Although the flavor is subtle when used in cooking, paprika is a great spice to keep in the spice cabinet. It is used a lot to add color to dishes and is often used as a colorful garnish. There are many different kinds that you can buy. I love keeping a smoky Hungarian Paprika in my spice cabinet.

**Chili Powder** - Typically not spicy, but can be, chili powder is great for adding a lovely depth of flavor in many Tex-Mex dishes and Chili. You can find many different kinds of chili powder in stores. Smoked, spicy or even a little sweet.

**Cumin** - So much earthy flavor packed into this little seed. We often use it in its ground form. Think tacos, that's the strong flavor you are tasting when eating tacos. Cumin is one of my favorite spices to use. It is used in everything from chili to curry dishes. I use a lot of cumin in Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes.

**Ginger** - This is another spice great for using in sweet and savory dishes. Ginger is used in dishes like curries as well as pumpkin pie.

**Cinnamon** - Everyone knows that cinnamon is great in baked goods. But it is also great in savory dishes like curries. Cinnamon is one of my top essential spices.

**Cloves** - Perfect for Fall and Winter baking, cloves are a great spice that pack a punch.

**Nutmeg** - This underrated spice packs so much lovely warm flavor. Add it to baked goods, soups and sauces. Be careful to not overdo it, a little goes a long way with this spice. Fresh nutmeg is preferred but harder to find in grocery stores, so we often see it in its ground form.

**Crushed Red Peppers** - Great for adding spice to dishes. A must have for topping pizzas!

**Cayenne Pepper** - When you really want to spice up a dish, cayenne pepper is a great spice to use. Use a little to start with because it is SPICY!

## Dried Herbs

Another great way to add flavor to your food is to use dried herbs. Dried herbs can add a great depth of flavor to any dish. To get the most flavor out of dried herbs, you will want to add them at the beginning of cooking, not at the end, which you typically do with fresh herbs. Since they are dry, they will need moisture to liven them back up.

Dried herbs are best when cooked with, not as a finishing herb, like fresh herbs are used. The herbs I have listed are great for the beginner cook to start with.

**Oregano** - My most used dried herb in the kitchen. Oregano has such great flavor and is used to flavor so many different dishes. From pasta sauces, pizza sauce to fried chicken. You cannot go wrong with this dried herb.

**Basil** - Another great dried herb to keep in the spice cabinet. It is great for seasoning pasta sauce, meats and vegetables.

**Thyme** - This herb is great for seasoning everything from meats to marinades. It has a very strong flavor and can really stand out in a dish.

**Parsley** - Used mainly for a garnish but it does add a little flavor to dishes.

Once you figure out how to use spices and herbs, you will be able to elevate any dish. You can also cut out buying most of your specialty spice blends like taco seasoning and pumpkin pie spice by keeping your spiced cabinet stocked with the spices that make up those blends.
