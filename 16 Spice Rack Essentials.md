16 Spice Rack Essentials

*Disclosure: This post contain affiliate links. However, this list is entirely comprised of spices that I actually use in my kitchen on a regular basis.*

Let’s talk about spice rack essentials. My number-one priority in stocking a new kitchen would be filling the spice rack with my favorite spices. I cook from scratch and avoid pre-packaged food as much as possible, so spices are a must! I would be lost without them.

These 16 spices and seasonings are ones that I use regularly in my recipes. While I occasionally will pick up another spice for a special recipe I’m trying (such as an Indian dish like [Tomato-Butter Sauce](https://www.asavoryfeast.com/tomato-butter-sauce-from-the-new-indian-slow-cooker-cookbook/ "Tomato-Butter Sauce from The New Indian Slow Cooker Cookbook")), I rely on some combination of these 16 spices in my everyday cooking.

1\. [Onion Powder](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005XMXRU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0005XMXRU&linkCode=as2&tag=asafe0c-20&linkId=P7NIHEHKNHM7WMM2)

Out of these 16 spices and seasonings, I use the first 4 (Onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper) the most. Typically every meal I make uses these 4 spices, sometimes adding in a few others depending on the dish I am making.

## How to Add Spices When Cooking

Cooking can be a bit less structured than baking because you don’t have to be as strict with measurements.

You can add in a little more or a little less of a spice to customize the dish to your taste. I also like to add in spices that a recipe doesn’t call for to make it my own.

## What about fresh spices and herbs?

Another favorite spice that I didn’t add to this list is cilantro. I use it regularly in recipes, but it is so much better fresh! I always buy it fresh from the store rather than using dried cilantro.

I also like to use fresh rosemary and fresh basil whenever I can. It really adds so much extra flavor!

Having a home herb garden is a great way to have these items on hand all of the time. I grow my own basil, green onions and more so that I can cut off a little whenever a recipe calls for it.

**Would you add anything to this list? What are the spices that you use the most in your kitchen?**
