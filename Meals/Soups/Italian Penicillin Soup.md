### Ingredients

- 8 cups lower-sodium chicken broth
- 1 medium (8 ounce) sweet onion, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)
- 2 medium (3 ounces each) carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 2 medium (2 ounces each) celery ribs, coarsely chopped (about 1 1/3 cups)
- 6 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 4 (3 inch) thyme sprigs
- 2 fresh bay leaves
- 1 (2-ounce) Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind, plus grated cheese for garnish
- 4 ounce uncooked pastina pasta (about 1/2 cup)
- 2 cups (8 ounce) shredded rotisserie chicken (from 1 [3 pound] chicken)
- Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

### Instructions

- Gather all ingredients.
- Bring broth, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan or small Dutch oven over high; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables and 1 cup of broth to a blender.
- Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Stir blended carrot mixture back into soup.
- Add thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Add pasta, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 18 to 20 minutes, adding shredded chicken in the last 3 minutes of cooking.
- Remove from heat. Remove and discard thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind.
- Serve immediately, and garnish with parsley and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Recipe developed by Craig Ruff
