# Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 2 cups diced poblano peppers
- 1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- 0.5 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 (8.5 ounce) boxes dry corn muffin mix (such as JiffyÂ®)
- 2 eggs
- 0.66666668653488 cup milk, divided
- 8 ounces frozen corn, thawed
- 4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- 4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided

# Directions

- Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
- Cook and stir ground beef in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat starts to brown and release its juices, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in poblano peppers, salsa, salt, dried chipotle pepper, and oregano. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, whisk one package corn muffin mix in a large bowl with one egg and 1/3 cup of milk until combined; spread into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle corn over top, followed by 1/2 of the Cheddar and 1/2 of the Montery Jack. Spread beef mixture over the cheeses.
- Mix remaining corn muffin mix, egg, milk, Cheddar, and Monterey Jack in a bowl; carefully spread over beef mixture to within 1/2 inch of the edges of the dish.
- Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes.
