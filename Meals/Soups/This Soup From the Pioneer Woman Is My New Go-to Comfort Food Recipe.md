I love summer—the warmth, the seemingly endless daylight, and all of the produce that goes with it. It brings me so much joy. That’s why I’m always a little bit sad when summer leaves and fall slides in. Fortunately, I have soup to console me. And I can thank The Pioneer Woman for my first soup of this fall season— [Ree Drummond](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/ree-drummond-chicken-parmesan-pasta-bake-recipe/) approved.

Soup is my happy place. It feeds my heart and my soul. The action of gliding my spoon through a creamy [butternut squash bisque](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/55451/butternut-squash-bisque/) or [a brothy miso](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/miso-soup-recipes/) is so comforting and satisfying. How can something often considered so simple, be so special?

It’s all in how you make it. That’s why when I saw The Pioneer Woman’s version of chicken [tortellini soup](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/tortellini-soups/), I had to give it a try.

It starts with a quick sauté of carrots, onion, and celery. Once those are softened, garlic, red pepper, and Italian seasoning are added and cooked briefly before filling the pot with chicken broth. It’s all brought to a boil, then reduced to a simmer. Then pulled pieces of rotisserie chicken and a bag of refrigerated tortellini are added. Finally, it’s finished with a bit of Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley.

## What Makes This Chicken Tortellini Soup So Good

- It comes together quickly. Thanks to the use of convenience items, such as [rotisserie chicken](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/ways-to-use-rotisserie-chicken/) and quick-cooking [tortellini](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/ways-to-use-tortellini/), this dish takes less than 30 minutes to cook.
- It takes one pot. That’s right, it’s a one-pot meal at its finest. If you’re anything like me, that’s important because I’d rather be eating soup than doing dishes.
- It’s satisfying. I’ll eat just about any soup, but not my husband. His soup needs to be hearty in order to enjoy it. The combination of protein from the chicken and the carbohydrates from the pasta makes this a filling, [comforting bowl of soup](https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/top-rated-soups/).
- It can be modified. One of my most favorite things about the recipe is that it comes with lots of suggestions for customization. I’m a huge fan of experimenting and “coloring outside the lines” when it comes to recipes, so I appreciate the thoughtful ideas for swaps and additions. Don’t skip the suggestion of adding lemon juice! More on that in a second.

## How I Make This Soup Recipe My Own

- Add the [Parmesan rind](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-use-parmesan-cheese-rinds/). If resources permit, buy a block of parmesan cheese. Cut off the rind and add it to the soup at the same time you add the broth. It’ll deepen the flavor of the soup, imparting a lovely salty, [umami taste](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-umami/). Remove it before serving.
- Squeeze in lots of lemon. One taste of the finished soup and I knew it needed some acid. I went with lemon because I had it on hand, but red wine vinegar or white vinegar are also viable options. Start with 1 tablespoon and taste. If it needs more, add additional acid by the tablespoon until it tastes bright and savory.
- Throw in more veggies. The amount of veggies in the recipe is good, but to make this soup heartier, I recommend adding more. I added 1 more stalk of celery and an additional 2 medium carrots and loved it. You may need to tack on a few more minutes of initial cooking time since you’ll have more veggies, so just keep that in mind. As the recipe site says, spinach (about 3 cups) works nicely as an add-in, too, which can go in when the chicken and tortellini get added.
- Use a good tortellini. There are some pretty bland versions out there. I recommend finding a brand that you love and using that. Otherwise, they’ll just make the soup feel boring.
- Finish with a little butter. Adding a tablespoon or two of butter at the end is a delicious way to make this soup feel even more luxurious. It’s not necessary, but is the perfect finishing touch.

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
- 4 stalks celery, sliced
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 quarts low-sodium chicken broth
- 3 1/2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken
- 1 (20-ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- Optional: Parmesan rind

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion, and cook, stirring often until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes.
2. Pour in broth and bring to a boil.
3. Add chicken and tortellini, and cook, stirring occasionally until chicken is warmed through and tortellini are tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Portion into bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese and parsley.

Try this: Let the soup cook (before adding the chicken and tortellini) over low heat with the lid on to develop more flavor. An extra 20 to 30 minutes really helps make this soup even more delicious. While you’re at it, add that Parmesan rind too! Just remember to take it out before serving.
