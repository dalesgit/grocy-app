Having a well-stocked pantry and fridge is like money in the bank. With basic supplies on hand, you'll be equally prepared to put together a family-friendly meal or a last-minute dinner for friends. The trick is figuring out what to stock up on and what you will likely never use.

Consider the checklist below a rough sketch; only you can determine the essentials based on your palate, repertoire and needs. Trying to cut back on meat? Skip the Italian sausage and swap in frozen wild-caught shrimp. Don't like peanut butter? Pick up a tub of hummus instead. The idea is to make sure you have enough proteins and sturdy vegetables to pull together several satisfying meals, plus some flavorful condiments and seasonings to keep things interesting (even on a school night).

Whatever you decide to toss in your shopping cart, you can rest happy knowing you won't ever again have to call spaghetti with butter dinner â€” unless that's exactly what you're in the mood for.

### Dried Black Beans

Dried black beans are perfect for whipping into creamy, rich dishes. Make sure to soak your beans overnight, or skip the step entirely by cooking them in a pressure cooker or slow cooker.

### A Cool Way to Use Any Kind of Black Beans

If you didn't think a brownie could be healthy, think again with Melissa d'Arabian's [Black Bean Brownies](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/melissa-darabian/black-bean-brownies-recipe-1924213). By blending cooked black beans (either canned or dried) into the brownie mix, the taste will go undetected but add an irresistible rich, gooey texture.
