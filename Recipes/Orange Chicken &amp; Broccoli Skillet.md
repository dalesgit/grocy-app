### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 6 (6-ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, patted dry
- 1⅛ teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- ¾ cup orange juice
- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger
- 1½ teaspoons cornstarch, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground pepper
- 2 (8.8-ounce) packages precooked microwaveable brown rice
- 6 cups fresh broccoli florets
- ¼ cup thinly sliced scallions
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

### Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350°F. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with ¼ teaspoon salt. Arrange the chicken in the skillet skin-side down; cook, undisturbed, until the skin is golden brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the chicken, skin-side up, to a large plate. Remove the skillet from the heat; reserve 1 tablespoon of the drippings in the skillet (discard remaining drippings).
- Meanwhile, whisk 1 tablespoon orange zest, ¾ cup orange juice, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar, 2 teaspoons ginger, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Pour ½ cup of the mixture into a small saucepan.
- Add the remaining ½ teaspoon cornstarch and ¼ teaspoon salt to the orange juice mixture in the bowl. To the reserved drippings in the skillet, add 2 packages rice, 6 cups broccoli and the orange juice mixture from the bowl; stir until well combined. Nestle the chicken, skin-side up, into the broccoli mixture.
- Bake until the broccoli is tender, the sauce has thickened slightly, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of chicken registers at least 165°F, 40 to 50 minutes.
- Meanwhile, bring the reserved orange juice mixture in the saucepan to a lively simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with ¼ cup scallions and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds.
