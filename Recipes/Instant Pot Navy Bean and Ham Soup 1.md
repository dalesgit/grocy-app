# Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 carrot, shredded
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 (24 ounce) package dried navy beans (such as Hurst's®)
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1 pound fully cooked ham, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

# Directions

- Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Sauté function. Heat olive oil in the pot; add celery, carrot, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Turn off Sauté mode.
- Stir chicken broth, beans, paprika, and thyme into vegetables in the pot. Close and lock the lid; move the valve to Sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 34 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Select Cancel/Keep Warm when cooking is done. Release pressure for 10 minutes using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions. Move the valve to Venting and release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes.
- Unlock and remove the lid; stir ham and tomatoes into bean mixture. Close and lock the lid; move the valve to Sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
- Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Season soup with salt and pepper.
