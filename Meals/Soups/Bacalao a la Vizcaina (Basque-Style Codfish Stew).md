# Ingredients

- 1 pound salted cod fish
- 4 medium potatoes, sliced thick
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- 4 large hard-boiled eggs, sliced
- 2 teaspoons capers
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced
- 0.25 cup pitted green olives
- 1 (4 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained
- 0.5 cup golden raisins
- 1 large bay leaf
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 0.5 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 cup water
- 0.25 cup white wine

# Directions

- Soak salted codfish in about 2 quarts of water, changing the water three times over the course of 8 hours. Drain, then cut codfish into bite-sized pieces.
- Layer 1/2 of each ingredient in a pot in the following order: potatoes, codfish, onions, hard-boiled eggs, capers, garlic, olives, roasted red peppers, and raisins. Place bay leaf on raisins, then pour 1/2 of the tomato sauce and 1/2 of the olive oil over top. Repeat layers in the same order, skipping bay leaf. Pour water and white wine over top; do not stir.
- Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
