# Ingredients

- 4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks, or more to taste
- 4 large carrots, chopped, or more to taste
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 0.5 stalk celery with leaves, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon beef bouillon powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- water as needed
- 1 pound lean ground beef

# Directions

- Combine potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, garlic, parsley, basil, bouillon, salt, and pepper in a large soup pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover. Cover the pot and bring to a boil; cook until vegetables begin to soften, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
- Crumble in ground beef, a little at a time, stirring between additions. Return to heat and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat and cook at a simmer until vegetables are cooked through and meat is no longer pink, 15 to 20 minutes.
