# Ingredients

- 0.5 pound dried pinto beans
- 0.5 cup vegetable oil, divided
- 8 ounces raw shelled pumpkin seeds
- 1 pound tomatillos - husked, cored, chopped
- 1 bunch arugula leaves, chopped
- 10 serrano peppers, chopped
- 10 leaves fresh spinach, chopped
- 10 leaves Boston lettuce, chopped
- 0.25 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 0.25 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 quarts vegetable stock, or more as needed
- 2 (29 ounce) cans white hominy, drained and rinsed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

# Directions

- Place pinto beans in a large stock pot with enough water to cover; soak 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
- Cover beans with about 3 inches water in the same stock pot; cook over medium-low heat until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Drain.
- Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add pumpkin seeds; cook and stir until light brown and popping, about 6 minutes. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
- Transfer pumpkin seeds and oil to a blender or the bowl of a food processor; blend until smooth. Add half each tomatillos, arugula, serranos, spinach, lettuce, parsley, and cilantro to the blender; blend until smooth. Pour into a large bowl. Repeat with remaining half each tomatillos, arugula, serranos, spinach, lettuce, parsley, and cilantro.
- Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a deep pot; carefully add tomatillo sauce. Simmer, stirring with a wooden spoon, until thickened, about 30 minutes.
- Add pinto beans, vegetable stock, and hominy to the pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, uncovered, until flavors are thoroughly blended, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
