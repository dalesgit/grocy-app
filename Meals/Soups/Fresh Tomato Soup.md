# Ingredients

- 4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 slice onion
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt

# Directions

- Gather the ingredients.
- Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves, and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes to blend flavors.
- Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.
- Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown.
- Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest.
- Season with sugar and salt to taste.
- Serve hot and enjoy!
