# Russian Zupfkuchen

A german recipe that has nothing to do with Russia. I like to make it vegan by using vegan margarine and soy milk and yoghurt.

## Dough

Sift flour, baking powder and cocoa powder into a bowl. Add sugar, salt and butter. Knead with your hands until a smooth crumbly dough forms.

Oil the cake pan. Spread half of the dough on the bottom of the pan, pressing it smooth with your hands. Add 3/4 of the remaining dough to the walls of the cake pan. Refrigerate the remaining dough.

## Filling

For the filling melt half the butter. Cut the remaining butter into small cubes and add to the molten butter, stirring until all the butter has melted.

Whisk together milk and starch.

Stir together all the ingredients for the filling until homogenous.

Pour the filling onto the prepared dough. Pluck the remaining dough into small pieces and spread them onto the filling.

In a preheated oven, bake the cake at about 200 Â°C for about 90 to 120 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil if it gets to dark.

Let cool to room temperature, then chill in the fridge overnight. Serve at fridge temperature.
